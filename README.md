# Matrix Photo Editor
The android app as presentation of research project for the Linear Algebra course.

The detailed report of the research: [Final_Report_Ivashko_Roi.pdf](https://github.com/VictoriyaRoy/MatrixPhotoEditor/files/8939921/Final_Report_Ivashko_Roi.pdf)

## Description
The objectives of this project are mainly focused on getting acquainted with the basic linear algebra methods on editing photos. In order to see the results of those methods, we created a full-fledged photo editor application.

This application has posibilities to choose a photo from your device, apply many different effects on it and then save the edited photo to gallery. For every effect there is a slider which determines the strength of the corresponding effect and shows in real time how the image was changed.

### Implemented effects:
* Brightness
* Contrast
* Saturation
* Noise
* Denoise (mean, median and Gaussian filtering)
* Double exposure (default, lighten, darken, add, subtract modes)
